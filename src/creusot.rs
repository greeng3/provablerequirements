//! Creusot — a category-1 engine, **#2: the first that earns `proven`**.
//!
//! D2 gives the core one meaning and lowers it to each engine; Creusot is **lowering #2**
//! (Kani was #1). The binding stays core-owned ([`crate::grounding`]), the language stays the
//! adapter's ([`crate::rust_adapter`]), and this module owns exactly one thing: how a gated
//! category-1 requirement becomes something Creusot can prove, and what its answer means.
//!
//! **Additive, like Kani — but in-crate.** Kani's harness is a separate `tests/` binary that
//! imports the subject; Creusot verifies the crate itself, so the harness is a new **module**
//! in the crate root (`#[cfg(creusot)] mod provreq_…;`) plus its source file. The subject's
//! own code is never edited — only a `mod` line is appended and then removed, and if the
//! subject has no `why3find.json` (the prover config) the installed Creusot's own canonical
//! one is copied in and removed again. This keeps Creusot on the additive side of the "does
//! provreq annotate the subject?"
//! question: it **consumes** the subject's existing `#[logic]` predicates, it does not write
//! contracts into them (the A6 contract-*draft* channel is a later slice).
//!
//! **Honest by construction (D8/D9) — and differently from Kani.** Creusot is a *deductive*
//! verifier: a discharged proof obligation holds for **every** execution (spec-relative), so
//! a pass is [`Basis::Proven`], the strongest rung. But an *un*discharged obligation is NOT a
//! counterexample — an SMT solver returning "unproved" means it could not prove the claim,
//! which may be because the claim is false **or** merely because the predicates lack the
//! logic contracts the prover needs to see inside them. There is no witness. So Creusot
//! yields [`Outcome::Holds`] or [`Outcome::Inconclusive`] and **never a `fails`**: mapping an
//! unproved goal to a refutation would be the overclaim D8 guards against, pointed the other
//! way. A definitive refutation needs an engine that produces a re-checkable witness (Kani).
//!
//! **What cannot be lowered is said, not approximated.** The gate guarantees a category-1
//! requirement is temporal-free (REQ024), so the target is small: `always`/`never` over
//! boolean combinations, optionally quantified. Anything this module cannot faithfully
//! express — a scope, a guard, an argument that is not the quantified variable — is a
//! [`NotLowerable`], which becomes an honest `unknown`.
//!
//! Implements: REQ031 (wire Creusot as cat-1 engine #2 — a grounded invariant earns a real
//! `proven` verdict).
