# Operator Workflow — Working Notes (WIP)

> **Status: in-progress deliberation, not a finished design.** Scratch for issue #5.
> Captures the deployment/engine-provisioning thread worked through so far; the operator
> journey itself is still being mulled. Nothing here is final. Builds on the merged adoption
> model in [applying-to-existing-repos.md](applying-to-existing-repos.md).

## Operator-journey spine (proposed skeleton, not yet agreed)

1. **First contact** — point at a subject repo → discover its Doorstop layout → propose the
   companion tree + name → operator confirms.
2. **Triage backlog** — classify each item (formalizable-now / falsifiable-only / stays-prose).
3. **Formalize one item** — translate → read-back confirm (D12) → validate grounding dry-run (D13).
4. **Verify** — run one engine → inspect the verdict tree.
5. **Annotate** — stage the working-tree proof-carrier edit; operator reviews + commits on their own forge.
6. **Living loop** — re-run on drift, act on stale verdicts.

Emerging questions to chase (→ candidate requirements): triage one-at-a-time vs bulk
LLM pre-sort + confirm; what state a half-finished formalization must persist; how backlog
coverage is shown; what happens when grounding finds no match.

## Packaging (sharpens A5-B)

Direction: an **installable package the operator runs in their own dev env**, not a container
with their repo mounted (that loses the ability to build in their env). The tool's process
must be **co-resident with the subject's build toolchain**; distribution channel is a
separate axis from where it runs.

- **R-pkg-1** — installs as a single self-contained binary into the operator's existing dev env.
- **R-pkg-2** — the executor invokes the subject's already-present **build** toolchain
  (discovered on `PATH`), never bundled/rebuilt. _(Correction: this is the build toolchain
  only — the verification engines are a separate, usually-absent concern; see below.)_
- **R-pkg-3** — install/distribution is independent of the subject's language (prebuilt
  per-platform binaries + script; `cargo install` a convenience, not the only door).
- **R-pkg-4** — single binary, multiple entry modes: headless subcommands (the CLI-first
  spine, scriptable) **and** a `serve` mode running a **local** web server hosting the
  **embedded** web UI (the A6 gate surface), co-resident in the dev env. Local-served, not
  hosted (hosted multi-repo = deferred A5-A). `serve` foreground default; `--background` /
  `--port` flags; no daemon manager yet.

## Engine provisioning — the core tension and its resolution

Multi-language is the endgame; Rust/qrusty is the **first** target, not the model. The
engines split by a **language-general law** — the dividing line is _what the engine consumes_:

- **Artifact-fed** — consume a portable artifact, need **no** subject build: TLA+/TLC, Alloy
  (spec), MonPoly/MFOTL (a trace — any language emits traces), Viper/Silicon (Viper IR),
  Z3/CVC5 (SMT-LIB). Language-agnostic → **ride in our tool container**, one image, all languages.
- **Toolchain-welded** — must type-check/compile the **real** code with its **real** deps
  (compiled _or_ interpreted): Rust Verus/Prusti, Python Nagini/CrossHair, C Frama-C/CBMC/VeriFast,
  Java KeY/OpenJML, Go Gobra, Ada GNATprove. Every language with a code-level deductive
  verifier has one → **provisioned into the subject's dev env**. Can't be containerized away
  without our container reproducing the subject's build (forbidden — Caution 1). This is the
  irreducible residual: **code-level proof — proved against a commit, not a model — is
  inseparable from the subject's toolchain.** No lowering trick escapes it.

**Topology (= A5-A instantiated on one host):** our container holds our tools + UI backend +
artifact-fed engines; a thin **installable agent** persists in the subject's dev env, exposing
the dev-env toolchain + run-the-built-exe over a socket the container reaches back through.
Socket: prefer a **Unix domain socket bind-mounted into the container** — no listening TCP
port (no attractive nuisance), OS file permissions as authz; localhost + mTLS only if
container networking forces TCP; SSH/TLS is overkill for same-host IPC.

**Architecture consequence — quarantine language-specificity:**

- Language-neutral, shared: the brain, the UI, lowering to portable IR, the artifact-fed
  engine container, the agent seam.
- A **per-language executor adapter** (behind the A5 executor interface) is the _only_
  language-specific place: detect toolchain, detect + **version-check** the welded verifier,
  drive build+verify, collect a trace. Adding a language = adding an adapter, not a rewrite.
  Rust/Verus is adapter #1.

**Engine requirements:**

- **R-eng-1** — engines split artifact-fed (portable-input, containerizable, language-agnostic,
  shared) vs toolchain-welded (need the subject's compiler/interpreter + deps, co-resident with
  the dev-env build); placement follows the **class**, not the language.
- **R-eng-2** — never silently install into the operator's env; detect presence **and
  version-compatibility**, report honestly; provision toolchain-welded engines into the dev
  env (devcontainer feature / documented install), with at most an opt-in, consent-gated setup helper.
- **R-eng-3** — coverage is gated by installed + compatible engines, reported first-class
  alongside A2's formalizability triage ("category unavailable — engine absent/incompatible").
- **R-eng-4** — toolchain-welded verification is handled by a per-language executor adapter
  behind the A5 seam; the core stays language-neutral; adding a language = adding an adapter.

**Sequencing:** for the qrusty walking skeleton the one engine (Verus) is toolchain-welded, so
it lives in the dev env either way → ship A5-B (Verus via a devcontainer feature). The
container-agent split earns its place only when artifact-fed engines (TLA+, MonPoly) come
online. The container topology is the **destination** for the engine zoo, not the skeleton's start.
